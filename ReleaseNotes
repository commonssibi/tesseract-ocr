Tesseract release notes, Sep 7 2006 - V1.01.

Fixes for this release:
Added mfcpch.cpp and getopt.cpp for VC++.
Fixed problem with greyscale images and no libtiff.
Stopped debug window from being used for the usage output.
Fixed load of inttemp for big-endian architectures.
Fixed some Mac compilation issues.

This version should read uncompressed 8 bit grey and 24 bit color tiffs
without having to have libtiff. It does a dumb threshold though, so don't
expect good results from poor contrast or images of natural scenes etc.

If you just run tesseract with no command line args you should now get a
sensible usage message on linux, with or without X-windows.

If you can get it to compile on a PPC Mac, it may now run correctly,
although not all the build issues are fixed yet.

Building Tesseract:
Windows:
Unpack the tar.gz archive
Open tesseract.dsw in DevStudio (preferably version 6, higher versions will be more difficult)
Set Win32 - Release as the active configuration.
Build.
Copy tesseract.exe from bin.rel up one directory level.
Run tesseract phototest.tif phototest
This will create phototest.txt.

Linux:
Unpack the tar.gz archive
./configure
make
Copy tesseract from ccmain up one directory level (or create a symbolic link)
Run tesseract phototest.tif phototest
This will create phototest.txt.
